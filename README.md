# Chrome Extension for Netflix Comments

This chrome extension allows users to create an account and leave comments on Netflix videos.

## Login

The user can create an account in the extension popup window. You only need to provide a display name and a valid email to create an account and for signing in. Once a user has created an account, they can open Netflix from the extension popup. The comment window will not appear unless the user has opened Netflix from this popup.

## Comments

Comments appear as the user gets to the time in the video when the comment was left. The timestamps for the comments are based on the time displayed in Netflix, meaning they display how much time is left in the video.
